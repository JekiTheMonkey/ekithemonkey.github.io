# Seamless Travel in Lyra

## Lyra

Seamless travel works in way with Lyra out of the box, however you'll encounter many issues with the initialization phase. Things like Player Controller (PC) and Player State (PS) may be initialized with the game features present in the current Lyra experience before the initialisation data has been provided by some source after the seamless travel, which is sometimes unacceptable.
